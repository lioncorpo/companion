# Node Types in IPFS Companion

> ![screenshot of node type switch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/42382479-b4d98768-8134-11e8-979c-69b758846bf0.png)<br/>


Available node types:

- [External](#%EF%B8%8F-external)
- [Embedded](#%EF%B8%8F-embedded)
- [Embedded + `chrome.sockets`](#-embedded--chromesockets)
- [Public](#-public)

## TL;DR

When in doubt, use _External_ node running on your localhost:
- [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop) is a GUI app for Windows/Linux/Mac that installs and manages local IPFS node for you
- If you prefer more hands-on approach:
  - install IPFS by following [Getting Started](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/) guide
  - or run it in [Docker](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs#docker-usage)
- If you are using [Brave](https://brave.com/), feel free to experiment with [Embedded + `chrome.sockets`](#-embedded--chromesockets).  
  You can always switch back to _External_ with local IPFS Desktop


## üõ∞Ô∏è External

_External_ node can be any instance of IPFS daemon that runs outside of web
browser process and exposes _Gateway_ and writable _API_ over HTTP at TCP ports.

At this time [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) daemon is preferred
implementation. It is easier on CPU and provides `dhtclient` mode which
decreases ambient bandwidth use and smaller battery drain (key characteristics
of something that is expected to run in background all the time).

A good practice is to run it on localhost (`127.0.0.1`) as it provides:
- Increased security (native IPFS used as end-to-end transport)
- Better UX in web browser (no mixed-content warnings)
- Improved performance (local loopback is used, no network overhead)

Don't know where to start? See [Getting Started](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/) instructions.


## üèóÔ∏è Embedded

_Embedded_ node is a js-ipfs instance running in browser (in-memory), without need for
any external software.

It is a work in progress but can be used for development and experimentation
eg. for testing a dapp that uses `window.ipfs` without having to install and
start up your own IPFS daemon.

Power users can provide [custom config](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#faq) (eg. to enable experimental pubsub) [via _Preferences_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/38084660-0b97c0cc-334e-11e8-9368-823345ced67f.png)

**Note:** at the time this note was created, Embedded js-ipfs running within webextension (browser context) comes with some limitations:

- Can't act as an HTTP gateway (extension uses public one as a fallback)
- Known to be CPU-hungry
  ([#450](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/450),
  [ipfs/js-ipfs#1190](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1190)) over time, which may drain your battery,
- Missing DHT ([js-ipfs/#856](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/856))
- Default transports limited to websockets ([js-ipfs/#1088](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1088))
    - Lack of connection closing
    ([ipfs/js-ipfs#962](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/962))
    - Missing relay discovery ([js-ipfs/v0.29.x/examples/circuit-relaying](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/v0.29.3/examples/circuit-relaying))
- The Embedded node _does not run_ when External node is selected.  Every time
  you switch back to the embedded node, a new instance is created on-demand. It
  can take [a few
  seconds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/38493690-4a77bd9e-3bf3-11e8-85da-ba06fd94cdbf.gif)
  for a brand-new node to find peers.

When in doubt, run go-ipfs as External node instead.


## ü¶Ñ Embedded + `chrome.sockets`

This node type replaces regular _Embedded_ type if browser vendor granted us access to `chrome.sockets` APIs.  
Those powerful APIs enable embedded js-ipfs to provide true p2p experience without the need for external daemon:

### üö™ HTTP Gateway
- access IPFS resources over HTTP without relying on a public gateway
- automatically picks a free localhost port

###  üöÑ TCP transport
- embedded js-ipfs is able to connect to go-ipfs
- go-ipfs is able to connect to embedded js-ipfs

### üîÆ Local Discovery (mDNS/DNS-SD)

- embedded node discovers go-ipfs in LAN  and automatically connects to it

**Note:** this is still work in progress, see [Embedded JS-IPFS in Brave](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/716) for the current status.

## üåê Public

Public node is not a part of the toggle UI. It is used as an implicit fallback for its Gateway functionality when External node is offline or Embedded node is used.
It does not expose API port.
