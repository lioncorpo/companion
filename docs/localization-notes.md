## Contributing Translations

Just go to https://crowdin.com/project/ipfs-companion  and start translating!

If your language is not present in `add-on/_locales` yet, but is supported by mainstream browsers
please create a [new issue](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/issues/new) requesting it :+1: 

Same if anyone want to become a proofreader for a specific language:

> Difference between translators and proofreaders:
> 
> - translators can suggest translations for empty or translated strings and vote on existing ones
> - proofreader can translate and suggest (of course) but will lose their Voting feature to get a more powerful "Proofreader " button that allows them to approve or reject translations

Don't worry if GitHub does not reflect translations added at Crowdin:
translations are merged manually before every release.

It is a good idea to opt-in for email notifications about any new strings in future:
https://crowdin.com/settings#email

Thanks again for your translations!


## Running Chrome with specific locale

Chrome comes with locales out of the box, so it is enouh to set proper env:

    LANGUAGE=pl chromium --user-data-dir=`mktemp -d`

## Running Firefox with specific locale

Unless user installed locale-specific build, Firefox will have English only.  
If your build already has the locale you are interested in, skip step #2.

1. Set `intl.locale.requested` in `about:config` or commandline via:
   ```
   web-ext run --pref intl.locale.requested=pl
   ```
2. Install language pack from https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/language-tools/
3. Reload browser extension â€“ it should detect new locale
