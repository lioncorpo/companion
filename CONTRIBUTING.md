## Make sure you invest your time in future-proof APIs :-)

Mozilla decided to deprecate old SDK and our main objective is to [rewrite addon using WebExtensions APIs](https://github.com/lidel/ipfs-firefox-addon/issues/20).

# Pull Requests

Are welcome :-)

Just make sure PR comes with its own tests and does pass automated TravisCI test.


# Tests

Make sure your changes follow code style and pass basic suite of regression and style tests.

Setting it up is easy. To install all dependencies run:


```bash
npm install jpm grunt grunt-cli -g
npm install

```

Remember to specify Firefox binary via `FIREFOX_BIN`. It will be used by `jpm test`.

Running test suite:


```bash
export FIREFOX_BIN=/path/to/firefox-45.0a2/firefox
npm test

```

And that is all.
